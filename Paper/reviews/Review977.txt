Comments to the author
======================

In this paper, compliant actuation arrangements were
compared in accordance with their success on the jumping
motion.

An optimization study is performed on the joint
trajectories to get the highest jump result of each
configuration.

Major Comments:
- The fundamental need for the explosive motions and the
jumping capability is not justified in the introduction. I
believe
that this part particular part must be expanded.

- Jumping level (height) highly depends on the specific
trajectory. It is possible to exploit resonance frequency,
for instance, to maximize the jumping motion; see Ugurlu et
al. "Bipedal Hopping Pattern Generation for Passively
Compliant Humanoids: Exploiting the Resonance", IEEE
Transactions on Industrial Electronics

- Paper is based on the comparison of the 3 different
structured robot legs, however, (other than the Fig. 2 and
the brief operation principal's explanation no quantitative
data (such as total mass, inertia, initial CoM position
etc.) were given throughout the paper. Dynamic parameters
of the each leg must be provided. 

Minor Comments:
- In page 1 paragraph 2, SEA abbreviation is used for the
first time and without an expansion.
- Fig. 5 is not readable in a printed copy
- Most of the sub figures' of Fig. 5 are not mentioned in
the paper if these figures do not have any additional
contribution to the paper, these sub-figures can be either
removed from the paper or rearranged.
- At page 6 paragraph 4, "Fig. 51" must be corrected.	

Comments on the Video
=====================

Compared motions must be labeled for a clear understanding.
