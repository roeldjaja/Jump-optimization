This work covers the optimization of the explosive jumping
motion of a 3-DOF leg by modifying joint trajectories and
actuator/elastic element properties. The reviewers raise
important points that should be addressed. The major issue
is seen as a lack of experimental result (even in the form
of early/initial results) that could provide enough data to
prove the optimization results.
