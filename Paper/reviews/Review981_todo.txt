Reviewer 3 of BioRob 2018 submission 98

Comments to the author
======================

GENERAL
The topic of the paper is of recent interest of the
biorobotics community. Biarticular actutation in elastic
robot designs has a high potential. The authors should
consider to integrate results and discussion as a new
results section, while giving a critical perspective in the
conclusion (or discussion & conclusion) section. Overall,
the results are very promising, but the lack of an
experiment with a real robot is clear limitation.

ABSTRACT
Is generally informative, but very vague regarding the
bi-articular design. Does not mention that his is only a
simulation study.
=> Fair enough. Let's change "The results demonstrate" to "A simulation study demonstrates"

INTRODUCTION
The introduction gives a good overview of the literature.
Addtional references regarding hopping and actuation might
be added (e.g., from groups of Vanderborght or Seyfarth).
The reviewer recommends not to present the results in the
introduction.
=> Additional references would be great but we lack space, especially since we are constrained to 6 pages. Highlighting the main results is a good practice I find, since it makes the reader enthousiastic about what's to come and why what is being done is worth it.

LEG DESIGN
The leg design is well described. Yet, some details might
be explained referring to Fig. 2.
=> We can reorganise Sec. II-B a bit, particularly to move the reference to Fig. 2 to the top of that subsection. That will give the reader a better understanding of the figure as they'll be reading that subsec and looking at the figure that same time.

MODELLING
The inertia, gravitation, and coriolis matrices should be
given. When optimizing for power and energy consumption, it
is recommendable to consider the electrical dynamics of the
actuator (see works by Verstraten).
=> No space. Agreed on the electrical dynamics, we should be more precise with point 5 in Sec. VI, where we suggest a more sophisticated torque penalisation would be better to actually penalise energy consumption.

DYNAMIC OPTIMISATION
Explaining the section substructure is not require, please
remove to give details elsewhere. The signs of the
components of the objective function should be explained.
=> We can remove the sentences after "We proceed as follows" to save 3 lines, indeed. Probably a good idea, but let's do all the modifications we want to do and then see where we can shave off lines.

RESULTS
While the observed trends are promising, it is hard to get
trajectories from Fig. 4 or to understand Fig. 5 and,
finally, the results are only vaguely described. More
details would be helpful.
=> We can consider removing Fig. 4, as it is not very informative. We can make a more horizontally aligned figure, or simply refer to the video (which we need to add it to). Removing this figure will give us a lot of space, in fact.

DISCUSSION
The results contained in the discussion section are very
interesting, e.g., torque requirements according to Fig
5g-5i. It appears that the separation between results and
discussion might not be appropriate. A critical perspective
is missing.
=> This reviewer also suggests to merge Sec. V and VI. I would have liked to know with regards to what he wants to see a critical perspective, but we can have another read-through to see what's missing.

CONCLUSIONS
The paper is concluded well, a critical perspective is yet
missing. Future works are meaningful.
=> Same.

Comments on the Video
=====================

Is informative, but too fast. Might benefit from more
animation, especially the compared
actuator/spring-mechanisms are hard to comprehend.
=> I will add more slow motions to the video, and extend the overall length. Animations of the mechanisms would be too much work for this paper.
