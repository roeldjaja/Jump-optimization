Reviewer 2 of BioRob 2018 submission 98

Comments to the author
======================

The paper presents the optimized jumping motion using
series elastic actuators. The paper compared the jumping
performance with various mechanical configurations such as
SEA-only, mono-articular, and bi-articular configuration.

The paper introduces design, modeling, and optimization but
the reviewer thinks the paper needs more brief information
for readers. However, the result is reliable and the
presentation is fine. The author seems to try showing
various results as many as possible, but some results are
redundant.

In detail, there are minor errors and reviewers comments in
the text and figures. In Abstract, the author mentioned `to
optimize the joint trajectories’. The author should appoint
the optimization object such as time, speed, performance
index, etc. In the introduction, `,’ is missed in the first
sentence,
=> While it is important to know what exactly is optimised on I think stating all the cost terms in the introduction is ridiculous. We can try to be more precise in our use of language, replacing the word 'performance' with more accurate words such as jumping height or power (but we should be careful not to over specify as this is not the only optimisation objective!).
 and a reference required for `A prime example’.
=> A reference to state that jumping is an example of explosive motions in humans is absurd.
References in the introduction are generally fine but need
more explanations for [4]-[12].
=> Would be nice indeed but we already have 3/4th page of introduction in a 6 page paper, we can't do more without compromising content. Save that for the journal paper.
And it is better to avoid using `almost’ in the scientific text.
=> Agreed we can remove this word, simply rounding the number is fine.

In Section II, what is `very different’?
=> We already refer to [12] where the reader can find the actual values and other details. What we can try to say in a short manner is that the ESB elastic element can store a huge amount of energy compared to the series-elastic element in the PB SEA.
And, need explanations for PE(Parallel?) and SE(Serial?).
=> We can add some words to indicate these are simply names "denoted as SE" etc.
At the end of Section II, need a simple explanation for [12].
=> ?

In Section III, there is a typo ‘inertiae’.
=> inertiae is plural of inertia, albeit less common.
In Section III.B, Equation (5) is wrong (Maa -> Mpa).
=> Yes please fix this
And like Section II, the paper needs a simple explanation for [11] (At the end).
=> ?

In Section IV, the explanation of optimization algorithm
has to be moved Section IV.C (Furthermore ~~).
=> Took me a bit to understand what he meant here.. Under (14) there is a sentence which refers to a later Section. We can consider it later.
The reviewer
doesn’t understand the sentence ‘Each simulation is
concluded when the CoM reaches its highest point’. How do
the authors know that the point is optimal?
=> We can explain this (CoM velocity is negative), but only if we find space.

In Section V, there is no explanation of the result here.
=> ?
And the reviewer cannot understand the Figure 5. Caption
(d) seems a typo.
=> Correct, 5a should be "No ESB". Please fix.
What is the variable of the x-axis of
each graph? time? The authors need to simplify the graph
for better presentation.
=> Let's add the fact that the horizontal axis is time to the figure caption.

Section VI has to be separated to Section V and Section
VII. Results have to go Section V and discussions has to go
Section VII.
=> I don't agree, it will make Sec. VII very hard to read, detailed analysis of results do not belong in a conclusions section. We can however consider to merge Sec. VI into V, to space space.

The reviewer thinks this paper is fine to present at the
conference but need to improve the quality of paper as
written above. Video is fine also.


Comments on the Video
=====================

Video seems fine.
